            Our TV is connected to our receiver with an optical cable.
            <br>
            Unfortunately someone decided that changing the volume doesn't affect the device connected via optical.
            <br>
            Therefore I decided to create an application that can capture the volume change on our Android TV.
            <br>
            This volume change is than relayed via HTTP to an ESP8622.
            <br>
            The ESP has an IR led connected which will send the volume change to the receiver.
            <br>
            Besides the volume the application also checks if the TV is on or off and turns the receiver on/off as needed.
            <br>

            The microwave power button and timer combination failed.
            <br>
            Instead of trowing it away I decided to make it smart.
            <br>
            By putting in a Raspberry Pi zero w and make it host a server/webserver to control a relay, the Microwave was alive again!
            <br>
            I also created a native Android app, because why not.
            <br>
            By accident the Microwave is now also controllable by the TV.
